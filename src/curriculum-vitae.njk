      <h3 class="h3">The elevator pitch</h3>
      <p><span class="lead">Nice to meet you, I’m&nbsp;Rob!</span> I’m a frontend developer from London with an agency background, known for creating <strong>digital experiences</strong> and <strong>web apps</strong> for enterprise clients, start-ups, and everyone in&nbsp;between.</p>
      <p>With a first-class degree in design and typography, I am particularly well suited to <abbr class="sc" title="user interface">UI</abbr> development where I can focus on consistency and a strong&nbsp;<abbr class="sc" title="user experience">UX</abbr>. Understanding design allows me to collaborate confidently with designers to create a best product&nbsp;possible.</p>
      <p>I have management and mentoring experience, and take pride in always looking to support others around me while also learning, and improving my own&nbsp;knowledge.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Skillset</h3>
      <p><span class="lead">A developer’s toolbelt requires constant updating,</span> so I aim to stay abreast of changes in the industry and keep learning to be able to provide the most solutions most suited to the problem at&nbsp;hand.</p>
      <p>Below are a few that I use currently, but it should be viewed fluidly with the understanding that with the a strong grasp of the fundamentals, new frameworks or techniques are picked up&nbsp;quickly.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Core web languages:</strong> <span class="sc">HTML</span>, <span class="sc">CSS</span>, JavaScript</li>
        <li><strong><abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> frameworks:</strong> Vue.js, React</li>
        <li><strong>Build tools:</strong> Webpack, Sass, Post<span class="sc">CSS</span>, Babel, Gulp</li>
        <li><strong><abbr title="Static site generation" class="sc">SSG</abbr>:</strong> Eleventy, Gatsby</li>
        <li><strong><abbr title="Continuous integration/continuous delivery" class="sc">CI/CD</abbr> &amp; collaboration:</strong> Git, Netlify, Travis <span class="sc">CI</span>, <span class="sc">NPM</span></li>

      <h3 class="h3">Fueled</h3>

      <p><span class="lead">In the six years at Fueled my role has evolved a lot.</span> After joining as a web designer, I transitioned into a <abbr class="sc" title="user interface">UI</abbr>-focused developer, took on management responsibilities, and was instrumental in forming a web department. Most recently I have moved into a maker role, centered around delivering the best solutions for our clients’&nbsp;problems.</p>
      <p>I’ve worked on high-profile projects like <strong>Apple</strong> where we built a gamified knowledge center to better inform employees when selling new devices; and bringing successful life-coaching to the web for <strong>Tony Robbins’ Robbins Research Institute</strong>. Other clients include <strong>Vanity Fair</strong>, <strong>Pinterest</strong>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://omstars.com"><strong>Omstars</strong></a>.</p>
      <p>Since joining – and with particular focus in the last few years – I have led the development on all things <a href="https://fueled.com">fueled.com</a>. In 2018 we tore everything down and set about building a component library in line with the new brand direction. Part of the challenge was convincing stakeholders of behind-the-scenes changes for a more stable code base including publishing it as a private <span class="sc">NPM</span> package for better consumption across multiple&nbsp;repositories.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">University of&nbsp;Reading</h3>

      <p><span class="lead">Throughout my degree I worked closely with the in-house design team,</span> and upon graduating was offered a full-time role as the new digital designer tasked with overhauling the core information pages on&nbsp;<a href="https://reading.ac.uk">reading.ac.uk</a>.</p>
      <p>With a bit of project scope creep, I ended up being the sole designer and developer associated with a complete redesign and redevelopment of the main university pages concerned with attracting prospective students and improving current student&nbsp;experience.</p>
      <p>The templates built in 2013 have stood the test of time are still used on parts of the site like the&nbsp;<a href="https://reading.ac.uk/library">library</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Freelance design and development</h3>

      <p><span class="lead">While at university and since,</span> I have taken on select freelance projects to finance my bike obsession! I’ve built agency web presences for <strong>Kickpush</strong>, rebranded sports personalities like <strong>Hotspur Related</strong>, and – for a while – ran a successful channel on YouTube centered around designing brand identities for famous content creators like&nbsp;KSI. There are also fun side projects – like my dad’s pizza recipe birthday microsite and a <span class="sc">LEGO</span> naming pointer – in the list&nbsp;below:</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Outside work</h3>

      <p><span class="lead">A balanced life is important,</span> and while I enjoy testing new develpment techniques in my evenings on occasion, you’re more likely to find me outside on my bike or running – I’ve been participating in triathlon since 2015. You can find out more about what I get up to <a href="/#life">on the&nbsp;homepage</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Higher education</h3>

      <p><span class="lead">In 2013 I graduated with a first-class honours</span> in <strong>Typography &amp; Graphic Communication&nbsp;<abbr class="sc" title="Batchelor of Arts">(BA)</abbr></strong> from University of Reading,&nbsp;UK.</p>
