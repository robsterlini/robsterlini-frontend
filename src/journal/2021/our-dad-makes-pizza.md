In 2019, my brothers and I gifted our dad his pizza recipe as its own website.

At the tail end of February I redesigned and rebuilt it. Having used it a number of times myself, I found the original design was fiddly and distracted from the recipe. Version 2 was much more pared down, and stripped away all of the superfluous fluff.

I tweeted about it at the time too, but tweets are so ephemeral:

{% tweet "1363806932038012930" %}

This is a very short journal entry to immortalise it a little more solidly.

Okay, you caught me… It was an excuse to try out embedding tweets directly into my Eleventy build (I used [Kyle Mit’s plugin](https://github.com/KyleMit/eleventy-plugin-embed-tweet) as a starting point), but if do you use the recipe, [let me know](/contact) what you think!
