*[SAD]: Seasonal Affective Disorder
*[RDC]: Run Dem Crew

Fair warning, this post has references to depression and mental health.

It’s important that we speak about these things, but not everyone is in the right place to do so right now. If this is you, pop it in a bookmark (if people still do that) and come back to it on another day, no drama.

We’ll start our story at RDC housekeeping.

Charlie Dark was always adamant that social media obfuscated the truth:

> Instagram is a highlight reel.

It’s a collection of freeze frames, moments in time that the poster as felt happy with sharing with the world (or at the very least those they have allowed to follow them).

  "",
  "A sunset snap of me looking out over the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol",
  "This is me in Bristol (left), most people know it as my happy place; and then again at Christmas (right), a time of year that I absolutely love."

In both of these photos, I was going through a really rough patch – whether it was coming to terms with leaving a city I adored, or struggling with a particularly challenging bout of SAD.

Neither of them show that…

I deliberately left out the links to the posts because if you read [the](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlYwnJuAAL5/) [captions](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7rUI5SnNY7/), they do both talk about the underlying feelings, but how easy is it to miss them when you’re scrolling through? Double tap the like, and move on assuming that all is well in their world.

In March 2020 I went through a pretty tough series of personal challenges.

One of my first thoughts in this unfathomably turbulent time was how to portray normality on Instagram… Which is completely bonkers!

Was it that I wanted to reassure people that I was okay? Or was it that I was worried what people would think if they knew I wasn’t?

I’m not ashamed of anything that happened, but equally wasn’t going to post ambiguous messages on Instagram or Twitter (apologies if it sounds like I’m doing that right now). I reached out to my closest friends and lent on them for support, privately.

So why did my socials have to represent normality in a deeply abnormal time?

Because that’s the norm. That’s the expectation.
