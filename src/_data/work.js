Whilst contributing to the code on the project, I was also heavily involved in the decision making around the direction of the product and regularly owned discussions around new features. A more inclusive web is incredibly important, so I ensured that WCAG AA accessibility standards were understood and met as a minimum, and that AAA was implemented wherever\xa0possible.',

I spearheaded the development, consolidating five stacks into two (decoupled) and exposed the components as an installable UI library for other internal tools. The Creative Director and I then spent honing the prospective client journey and adding polish to create a UX that both increased conversions and sparked joy within our users.',
