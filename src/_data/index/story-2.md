<time datetime="2014">2014</time> Craving a change of pace, I moved back to London to join Fueled – an agency focused on creative solutions to digital problems. I joined as a Web Designer, but found more and more enjoyment in building the experience for a user, not just deciding what it looked like.

I’ve gamified employee experiences for Apple, engineered web experiences to rescue you when you’re locked out for FixFix, and helped visitors get the best value in London for Keetoo.

<time datetime="2020">2020</time> In the years since joining Fueled, I helped oversee the creation of a Frontend team, and then a web team in which it could live. I have mentored and managed people at project and personal level, and worked hard to bring in and iterate on standards for the team to improve collaboration and our&nbsp;effectiveness.

As the lead developer on the internal Fueled website overhaul, I built a versioned component library so other developers could consistently communicate the Fueled brand.
