<time datetime="2007">2007</time> Mine starts when I realised I was bad at <span class="sc">RPG</span>s, but was good at designing web graphics for players of <span class="sc">RPG</span>s. Forum signatures turned into forum skins which required code. No biggie, I learned to hack away at the PHP in front of me until it did what I needed it&nbsp;to.

<time datetime="2010">2010</time> From there I followed the digital design route and went to the University of Reading where I fell in love with typography. Web type was my bread and butter, and it allowed me to keep tinkering with code for personal projects, and freelance&nbsp;clients.

<time datetime="2013">2013</time> I graduated with a first, and stuck around to be the one-man design-development team behind the relaunch of the university&nbsp;website.

As a freelance developer, I’ve had the pleasure of working with agencies like Kickpush to help them shape their web presence; brought a masonic lodge&sup1; into the digital age; worked with creatives in developing their visions for companies like Unifie. There was a time that I was the designer for KSI, but that’s a story for another&nbsp;day!

<small>&sup1; I’m not a mason, just a&nbsp;developer!</small>
