Since picking up triathlon in 2015, I’ve amassed a double-digit medal collection, including an {% smallCaps %}IM70.3{% endsmallCaps %} in Weymouth – a 1.2&nbsp;mile&nbsp;swim, 56&nbsp;mile&nbsp;bike, and a half-marathon&nbsp;run.

Training for triathlon keeps life varied with three disciplines to keep on top of, whether that’s swimming in a reservoir head-to-toe in neoprene, clipping merrily up hills on Cleo, getting aero with Alice, or pushing the earth down along the&nbsp;Thames.

That amount of cardio works up quite a hunger, but with my large, Italian appetite, I've got that covered&nbsp;too.

Away from triathlon, you’ll find me deep in the {% smallCaps %}LEGO{% endsmallCaps %} box while reminding people that it’s [{% smallCaps %}LEGO{% endsmallCaps %} not legos](https://legonotlegos.com), in North London watching my beloved&nbsp;Spurs.
