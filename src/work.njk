    <p>Having spent the better part of a decade at <a href="https://fueled.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fueled</a>, I worked on a wide range of projects with clients including <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Tony&nbsp;Robbins</strong>, <strong>Vanity Fair</strong>, <strong>Pinterest</strong>, <a href="https://svclnk.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ServiceLink</a>, <a href="https://bigpoint.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bigpoint</a>,<a href="https://omstars.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omstars</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://vizzy.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vizzy</a>.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest projects was the 2017 rebranding and the introduction of a design system. I worked closely with the creative director to architect a scalable component library that is still widely used&nbsp;today.</p>
    <p>I transitioned from a web designer to a solely frontend role soon after joining in 2015, helped grow with the team, and was a driving force in the inception of a Web Engineering Department. I had the great honour of mentoring and managing some fantastic enginners, and thoroughly enjoyed my time there.</p>

    <p>After graduating I was approached by the <strong>University of Reading</strong> who were looking for a creative developer to improve the applicant funnel of the university website. I worked with a small team to realign the design with the upcoming brand change, and to rebuild the core pages to be more versatile and more widely applicable across the university website.  It is still in use today on the <a href="https://rdg.ac.uk/library" target="_blank" rel="noopener">library homepage</a> and other integral parts of the prospective student journey.</p>
    <p>In a freelance capacity; I’ve built agency web presences for <a href="https://kickpush.co" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickpush</a>, rebranded sports journalists like Hotspur Related, and in 2013 I recorded an Envato Tuts+ course on <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/responsive-web-design-techniques">Responsive web design techniques</a>. Other clients include <a href="https://www.unifie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unifie</a>, and <a href="http://www.lodge192.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lion &amp; Lamb Lodge</a>.</p>
    <p>There are also fun side projects – like my dad’s <a href="https://ourdadmakes.pizza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pizza recipe birthday microsite</a> and a <a href="http://legonotlegos.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="sc">LEGO</span> naming pointer</a>.</p>
