Since picking up triathlon in 2015, I’ve amassed a double-digit medal collection, including an {% smallCaps %}IM70.3{% endsmallCaps %} in Weymouth – a 1.2 mile swim, 56 mile bike, and a half-marathon&nbsp;run.

Training for triathlon keeps life varied with three disciplines to keep on top of, whether that’s swimming in a reservoir head-to-toe in neoprene, clipping merrily up hills on Cleo, getting aero with Alice, or pushing the earth down along the&nbsp;Thames.

Away from triathlon, you’ll find me deep in the {% smallCaps %}LEGO{% endsmallCaps %}&nbsp;box while reminding people that it’s [{% smallCaps %}LEGO{% endsmallCaps %} not legos](https://legonotlegos.com); in {% smallCaps %}N{% endsmallCaps %}17, North London watching my beloved&nbsp;Spurs; or if the season is right, on the slopes looking for pistes to&nbsp;ski.
